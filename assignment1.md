## Data Reporting Critique

[Advocates worry vaccines will be out of reach for Black and Hispanic neighborhoods devastated by COVID-19](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/09/texas-coronavirus-vaccine-racial-inequality/)

### Clarity and Accuracy

* I would give this story a 4 because the reporter quickly identified that Texas neighborhoods with a majority of Black and Hispanic residents have less access to coronavirus vaccines as opposed to neighborhoods with a majority of white residents. However, the central insight from the data, that was teased in the headline, was that the same issues that "devastated" these minority areas, such as a lack of established public health centers and distrust from immigrants and communities of color, contributed to the lack of vaccine distribution. This information appeared to be buried in the second half of the story.

* I would give the data visualization for this story a 3. The data in the written portion of the story was very compelling, but the graphics didn't produce the same amount of impact. Below are my suggestions for improvement.
  * Change the colors so neighborhoods with high levels of racial and ethnic diversity are easier to view. (My hunch is that these are Texas Tribune's brand colors, so maybe not room to work with there).
  * The maps are shown in alphabetical order, but I would lead with Travis County. That map provides the clearest picture of what the written story is conveying.
  * Smaller, solid dots for vaccine sites may have been a better choice in simplifying the design of the graphics.
  
* For data accuracy, I'm giving this story a 5. For the vaccine sites, they sourced information from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Then for the neighborhood demographics, they utilized Census Bureau data. Combining the two was a good move, as opposed to using whatever demographic information the Dept. of Health Services provides.
  * A lingering question I had was whether the Census Bureau information now includes data from the 2020 count?
  * The editor's note at the top of the piece about announced vaccination hubs maintained this story's integrity, as the data could quickly change.

### Quality
* The overall quality of this piece was a 4. The data sourcing and written implementation was well-done and original. However, the lack of impact from the graphic was disappointing for the quality of source data.

### Type and Color
* The map graphics stood out from the story because of the Texas Tribune branding colors and bolded sans serif type among the black and white serif type of the rest of the story.
* Type - 5
   * I didn't even notice it until this question, which I take as the sign of good, user-intuitive design.
* Color - 3
   * I already talked about this earlier, but I'll add on to what I said. I think the hue of colors were too similarly muted, distracting from the disparities they should have been pointing out.
   
### Creativity
* For the creativity of the graphic, I give it a 4. Unfortunately, the execution rendered it less impactful than it could have been. But the graphic did put information in a viewing perspective, which appeals to a wider audience who may better interpret data that way.

## Pitch

### What can D.C. flu vaccine distribution of past teach us about COVID-19 vaccine distribution?

Source Information | Purpose
-----------------|----------------
CDC | national flu vaccine #s
D.C. health dept. | possibly regional flu vaccine #s
Community orgs | grassroots promotion/resources
D.C. officials | are the same officials with experience leading COVID vaccine distribution?

* This story is timely because vaccination is an important step in stopping the spread of COVID-19, reducing hospitalizations related to the virus, and ending the pandemic. Also, vaccine distrubtion has fallen short of what experts initially told us would happen.

* Sources to talk to:
  * D.C. public health officials
  * Staff at community organizations that colloborate with the city on flu shot promotion
  * D.C. residents who have gotten both a flu shot and the vaccine during the pandemic

* **I'm very interested to see what overlap there is with officials who have handled other vaccine distributions compared to the officials in charge of COVID vaccine distribution.**
