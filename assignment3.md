## West Texas Communities and Food Access

[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIUTcotd0DpVMdMr-TLmR6WSqLjLYQ__si_ADbVoMmU/edit#gid=0)

**Description:**

The West Texas Food Bank (WTFB) serves 19 counties that span 34,000 square miles, equatable to the size of Maine. WTFB only has two official locations. Rural communities are often served through mobile distribution and WTFB's partner organizations. Low-income residents in the secluded areas of WFTB's jurisdiction face both the challenge of accessing food for purchase as well as donated goods. 

My data identifies cities, towns and census-designated areas with populations and their distance from a grocery store and a food bank distrubition location. I want to analyze the equitability in access to a distribution location. This data will also help me to identify how many people live in a food desert. Which has an impact on all residents, no matter their income level.

**Data Points**

1. Classification (city, town, census-designated, community)
2. County
3. Population
4. Median household income
5. Grocery store
6. Distance from grocery store
7. Distance from food bank distribution location

For 1-4, I will pull that data from the Census Bureau. For 5-7, I will use Google Maps and the WTFB location list. It may also be worth adding an additional column to identify which food bank location serves that community.
